# Module-8

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My client was the Gaming Room and their objective was to create a web-based game based on the 1980s game "Win, Lose or Draw!" that would allow wider accesiblity to players from around the world. Originally an Android app, the Gaming Room wanted a more interactive experience with a diverse collective of players and teams. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was able to honor the development budget by articulating a list of options to the client in terms of operating systems and their capabilites. I understood from learning about the software development process of how to incorporate use the Agile methodology to ensure that the game's development stayed within the budget and the deadline.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The client offered a list of requirements and a detailed agenda of what type of game they had conceptualized. The client was very adamant and direct about the vision of making this game more accessible to a variety of players across the world.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would change the section that provided the capabilities and drawbacks of each operating system such as Windows and Linux. I would have given more details about how each operating system could suppport the concept in mind. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I had to view the concept from the perspective of the user. Taking into account and consideration of what the user requests and demands gives me the roadmap to follow, whether I'm drafting the code to recommending an operating system that proves to be optimal.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I always consult with the product owner to gather information of how the prduct is envisioned. Upon receiving the information, I consult with the team leader and delegate responsibilites in the software development process. During the software development, it is essential to have frequent meetings with the development team and the product owner to discuss progress, along with confronting any obstacles and changes that may arise.
